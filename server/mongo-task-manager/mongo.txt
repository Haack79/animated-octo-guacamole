this is the path name i run in the terminal to get server to place data in a folder 
$ /Users/brianhaack/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/brianhaack/mongodb-data
basically it is 
/path to fold witht he downloaded mongod to run server --dbpath=path to folder we made to hold the data


next is to use db admin tool , tool to work with the data a lot easier 
there are a few but popular is robomongo 3t and mongochef 
- they help with data visualization and see what data is getting read and written 

download install run robomongo3t
create a new db connection
right click to go to shell and run a command against mongodb 

can check version with db.version() and hit green arrow

connect and insert documents. 
connect from Node. use node db driver

go to mongodb doc and look up drivers
DRIVERS let you interact with mongo db database from a wide range of programming languages 

install npm i mongodb to work with node

open new terminal window, since db needs to be running to be connected
